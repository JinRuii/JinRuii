# 👋 Hi, I’m Dr.-Ing. Jin Rui (@JinRuii)

I’m a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Spatial Data Science at the Department of Geography, King’s College London, and formerly a Postdoctoral Researcher at the GIScience Research Group, Heidelberg University. I hold a Ph.D. in Spatial Planning from the Technical University of Dortmund. My work bridges urban health, geospatial AI, and data-informed planning to address sustainability, spatial justice, and resilience challenges in contemporary cities.
